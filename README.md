After cloning to your home directory, check out the proper branch and then run the `makesymlinks.sh` script. Links from 'dot' files pointing to these files will be created in your home directory. 

You may also copy over an instance of `env.local` from another machine and 
make appropriate changes. See `env.defaults` for format.
